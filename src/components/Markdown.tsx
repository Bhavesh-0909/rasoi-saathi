# ü•¶ Reducing Food Waste & Supporting Food Donation

## Why It Matters
Each year, billions of tons of food are wasted globally, leading to excessive greenhouse gas emissions and wasted resources. By reducing food waste at home and donating surplus food, we can significantly lessen our environmental impact and support those in need.

- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: Food that decomposes in landfills releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas that intensifies climate change.
- **Resource Waste**: Producing food demands substantial resources such as water, energy, and labor. When food goes to waste, so do these critical resources.
- **Impact Stats**:  
   - üåç **1/3 of all food produced globally is wasted**.
   - üå± **Reducing food waste could lower global emissions by up to 8%**.

> **Did you know?** If food waste were a country, it would be the **third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases**, after only China and the United States.

## üìã How to Reduce Food Waste at Home

1. **Plan Ahead**: Create a weekly meal plan before grocery shopping and stick to a list to avoid overbuying.
2. **Use the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Method**: Place newer items behind older ones in your fridge and pantry, so you use what you bought first.
3. **Store Food Correctly**: Store fruits and vegetables in the right conditions to extend their freshness.
4. **Repurpose Leftovers**: Try new recipes with leftover ingredients. [Find Recipes for Leftovers](#üçΩÔ∏è-find-recipes-for-leftovers).
5. **Track Expiry Dates**: Keep an eye on expiry dates and set reminders to use food before it spoils.

> **Pro Tip**: Use a food tracking app to remember what‚Äôs in your pantry, reduce waste, and save money!
